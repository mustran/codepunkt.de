When working on a JavaScript projects with lots of npm packages, you will encounter packages that don't do exactly what you want them to do or have bugs when used in a specific way.

## Inform the maintainers

`this is code` that is in a sentence

The most obvious thing to do is to contribute back to the community by at least letting the maintainers of the package know

- In case of a bug: Under which circumstances the bug appears
- In case of a missing feature or different behavior: What features or different behavior you would like to have and why

However, not all packages are maintained regularly and quite often, maintainers don't have the time and motivation to fix minor bugs or add very specific features that don't seem to benefit everyone else aswell.

```jsx
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import { css } from 'linaria'
import React from 'react'
import LogoSvg from './site-logo.svg'

const logo = css`
  width: 140px;
  height: 45px;
`

const SiteLogo = () => {
  return (
    <Link to="/">
      <LogoSvg role="img" className={logo} />
    </Link>
  )
}

export default SiteLogo
```

@todo: check if someone else has the same idea or already reported the bug

## Contribute back

@todo: open up a pull request

- cloud shell
  - has monaco editor
  - switch between powershell and bash by `pwsh` and `bash`
  - has a file storage linked for persistance, mounted as volume into docker containers
- powershell
  - use `Get-Command` and `Get-Help` with `-examples` and `-online` to find your way around azure commands
  - nouns starting with `Az` show new commands, `AzureRm` older ones, both based on ARM, and very old ones starting just with `Azure`, based on ASM
- azure cli
  - use `--help` to find your way around
- regions
  - pairing regions are used for duplication (can be chosen in cosmos db). for services where this is not selectable, each region has a default pairing region (e.g. westeurope has northeurope)
- resource groups are in a location, but that doesn't say anything about the locations of the individual resources inside of that group
- Certifications and security related information is listed at [Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/overview/trusted-cloud/)
- management groups group subscriptions and can be used to manage rights & policies on top of these subscriptions (for example policies that restrict available locations for all resources)
- terraform is problematic with ARM templates? https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/template_deployment.html
- lots of arm templates are available at https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates
- for SSD you pay the allocated size, for HD you pay only the used size
- VM shut down at operating system level via RDP, VM is in status "stopped" - still costs compute cost. clicking "stopped" in portal changes status to "stopped, deallocated" and you only pay for disk (not compute anymore)
- azure site recovery can be used for disaster recovery or backup for on-premise VM environments, e.g. hyper-v oder vmware setups
- different prices for different subscriptions (enterprise subscription that is fully or in parts pre-paid is usually cheaper). things can like VMs can be reserved over longer timespans, which also reduces prices. MSDN and other subscriptions can have hard spending limits, so they might be worthwhile for small or medium-scale exploration
- nested virtualization in VMs is supported starting from v3 templates
- VM images can be added to resell via marketplace. VM RDP access via gateway is available as Azure Bastion. Something along this lines that also allows application virtualization is Azure Virtual Desktop.
- vm extensions add post-deployment features to VMs, the custom script extension can for example be used to run a script on deployment (e.g. to install further software using chocolatey, apt-get etc)
- azure functions is build on azure webjobs. webjobs can be contiuous or triggered. a Host is a runtaim container for functions that listens for triggers and calls them. it is created and configured using a hostbuilder and can be invoked with start and run. run is endless, start finishes.

This article is a work in progress. Until it's finished, the main takeaway message is this: Accessibility is important. However, it is also a tradeoff in certain situations. Please continue to educate others about the importance of accessibility.

## Subheadline

Also, if you're not entirely sure, develop your websites and applications with basic accessibility in mind. Using semantic HTML elements and managing both tab index and focus properly are not a lot of work most of the times, yet help a lot!

```jsx
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import { css } from 'linaria'
import React from 'react'
import LogoSvg from './site-logo.svg'

const logo = css`
  width: 140px;
  height: 45px;
`

const SiteLogo = () => {
  return (
    <Link to="/">
      <LogoSvg role="img" className={logo} />
    </Link>
  )
}

export default SiteLogo
```

Also, there's more text here to see what it's like if there's more content below a paragraph of syntax highlighted code.

          <p>
            I'm Christoph Werner, a full-stack web developer based in Paderborn,
            Germany. I've been building stuff on the web for the last 20 years,
            working with companies and clients across various industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            My focus is on creating enjoyable, accessible and performant user
            interfaces and observable, reliable and scalable APIs. Over the last
            couple of years, i've helped build a few web applications and shaped
            a lot of developer tooling and processes.
